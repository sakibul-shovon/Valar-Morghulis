Story:
On a dangerous mission known as ”Valar Morghulis” meaning ”All men must die”, you,
a fearless soldier, venture into enemy territory for a mission that’s more like a one-way
street. Armed with tough gear and grit, your task is simple: mess up the enemy’s plans
by taking out as many of them as you can. Sneaking through the shadows, you hit
important targets and create chaos. The enemy catches on, and the fight gets tougher.
With time running out, you’re racing against the clock to make a big impact
